Getting support for spi not working
hi.
try to add this in pitb.cfg
for me at 48v give-me 0,5ยบ if you have a diferent value maybe i have a brokem board, i no have fan and motors working only temp and this 0,5c


i look strider fysetc https://github.com/FYSETC/Stridemax_Dual_FD/blob/main/SCH%26PCB/StrideMax%20Dual%20FD%20SCH%20V2.0.pdf
